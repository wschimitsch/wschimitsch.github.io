## (WIP) Photography Website ##

Home for artwork and photography from Lauren Clark.

While I build out this website, it will live on my GitHub pages account so I can still deploy it for free for others to see (temporarily). Once complete, this will be moved to a different repo and deployed to a real domain/static website builder.

Access the website [here](https://wschimitsch.github.io/).
